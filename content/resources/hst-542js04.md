description: Electrocardiography provides visibility into the heart's electrical activity,
  helping doctors diagnose a wide range of cardiac abnormalities. For example, a blockage
  in the right bundle branch of the intraventricular conduction system (inset) produces
  a particular set of characteristic ECG signals. (Figure by MIT OCW.)
